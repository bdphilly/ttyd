React Autocomplete
==================

Accessible, extensible, Autocomplete for React.js.

Docs coming soon, for now just look at the `propTypes` and examples :)

Stuff we need help with:

- mobile support verification generally
- default mobile styles/positioniong (you'll notice the styles are
  pretty lean, on purpose, apps should style this however they'd like)
- tests (eventually)
